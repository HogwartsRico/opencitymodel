# Open City Model
Open City Model is an initiative to provide open [citygml](https://www.citygml.org) data for all the buildings in the United States.  By using other open datasets such as [USBuildingFootprints](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) in conjunction with our own code and algorithms it is our goal to provide 3D geometries for US building inventory.

The project is currently in a *beta* release.


# The Data

| State        | Files        | Size  |
| ------------ |-------------:| -----:|
| [California](http://ocm-citygml-beta.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/California/) | 266          | 53GB |


# FAQ

### How can I read citygml files?
There are a lot of great options on the [citygml website](https://www.citygml.org/software/)

### What is included in the files?
The files currently only contain building data and focus specifically on the 3d geometry of the building.  We also include a few fun/useful attributes such as the area of the footprint, the measured height of the building, the US state & county (FIPS code).

### Will you be releasing more citygml files in the future?
Our current plans include releasing files covering all buildings in the United States.  Beyond that we don't have any plans, but we are open to talking about it.
