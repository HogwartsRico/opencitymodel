# Open City Model
Open City Model is an initiative to provide open [citygml](https://www.citygml.org) data for all the buildings in the United States.  By using other open datasets such as [USBuildingFootprints](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) in conjunction with our own code and algorithms it is our goal to provide 3d geometries for US building inventory.

The project is currently in a *beta* release.
